Mealify
=======
Just a temporary name, we can do development stuff here, easier than just emailing zip files back and forth.

Current status:
 - Parses the list of all the recipes on allrecipes.com
  - Each recipe prints out the following data:
    - Ingredients (amount & type)
    - Directions

Future Plans:
  - Get up and running with some sort of web framework, preferrably flask or rails
  - Set up a database, probably postgresql
  - Recipes should parse nutritional information as well
