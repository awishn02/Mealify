Mealify
=======
Just a temporary name, we can do development stuff here, easier than just emailing zip files back and forth.
(update on the name, it exists already whoops, just leave it here until we come up with something else)

Current status:
 - Parses the list of all the recipes on allrecipes.com
  - Each recipe prints out the following data:
    - Ingredients (amount & type)
    - Directions

Future Plans:
  - Get up and running with some sort of web framework, preferrably flask or rails
  - Set up a database, probably postgresql
  - Recipes should parse nutritional information as well
